Light Up The Night

mod id "lutn"

Bring a little light to your darkness.
Street and traffic lights are still working hard, dim as they are. And those flag enthusiasts sure build to last! Last minute addition of a makeshift light pole. It's a bit flimsy, but you won't burst a hernia hauling it around. Created for Cataclysm ver. 0.G Stable. (It is very simplistic, will likely work on experimental with minor tweaks.)
