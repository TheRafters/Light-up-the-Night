Light Up The Night

mod id "lutn"

Bring a little light to your darkness.
Street and traffic lights are still working hard, dim as they are. And those flag enthusiasts sure build to last! Added crafting of a makeshift light pole, less efficient and durable, but far easier to move around. Created for Cataclysm ver. 0.G Stable. (UPDATE TO EXPERIMENTAL COMPLETED June 5th, 2023.) TODO: Convert overwrites to copy-from/extend.
